# Data Science and Machine Learning projects
A few DS/ML Mini projects are uploaded here including classification problem (e.g. classify recipe site traffic) and portfolio optimization (e.g. risk-return tradeoff between different stocks). 

An efficient frontier of a [portfolio optimization project]([url](https://github.com/tanmoyie/Data-Science/blob/master/Analyze%20Stock%20Portfolio%20for%20Risks%20and%20Returns.ipynb)) is shown below:
